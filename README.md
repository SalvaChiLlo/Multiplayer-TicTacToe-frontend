# Multiplayer TicTacToe

WebApp game developed with Angular - Typescript - Websockets

You can test it here: https://tictactoe-online.tk/

Backend for this game is here: https://github.com/SalvaChiLlo/Multiplayer-TicTacToe-server


## This game is still in development so many features will be comming soon
It's an alpha version so at the moment, only can be played for two people.

Soon I'll be adding rooms so people will be able to choose who can play with.

As it's based on my HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT [version](https://github.com/SalvaChiLlo/tic_tac_toe) it's still not using all Angular capabilities as well as its way of work
