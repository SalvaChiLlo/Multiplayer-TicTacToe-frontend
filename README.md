# Multiplayer TicTacToe

WebApp game developed with Angular - Typescript - Websockets - Firebase (Frontend Hosting)

You can test it here: https://tictactoe-online.tk/

Backend for this game is here: https://github.com/SalvaChiLlo/Multiplayer-TicTacToe-server


## This game is still in development so many features will be comming soon
##### Due to Heroku limitations maybe you have to wait about 30 seconds so the server responds
It's an alpha version so, at the moment, only can be played by two people.

Soon I'll be adding rooms so people will be able to choose who can play with.

As it's based on my HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT [version](https://github.com/SalvaChiLlo/tic_tac_toe) it's still not using all Angular capabilities as well as its way of work
